Antiquify text with this unique jQuery plugin. Randomly applied aberrations makes text look like it came straight off an old, antique printing press.

Antiquify.js is easy to use! Simply link to the Antiquify.js file in your header...

    <head>
      <title>Your webpage</title>
      <script src="your-js-path/jquery.antiquify.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>

...and call the Antiquify function on the elements you want to antiquify!

    $("p.text").antiquify();
